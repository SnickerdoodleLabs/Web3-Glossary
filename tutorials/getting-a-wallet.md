# How to set up a crypto wallet

A [wallet](/COMMON.md/#wallet) is your starting point in Web3. Without one, you cannot own any digital assets! The two most common forms of crypto wallets are
browser extensions and mobile applications. 

In general the steps for safely installing and backing up you crypto wallet are:

1. Choose a high quality wallet provider (see below) that is compatible with the digital assets you own or want to buy (i.e. Solana, Ethereum, Algorand, etc.)
2. The wallet will generate a seed/backup phrase during installation. Save it somewhere safe (like a password manager) and never share it with anyone.
3. Use the wallet to create new crypto account addresses which can be used to interact with your digital assets on the blockchain. 

## Browser-based wallets

Browser-based wallets are distributed as browser extensions and are usually compatible with most popular web browsers (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc). These wallets are installed in your browser environment; they are not native applications and they cannot access your computerâ€™s underlying operating system. Some of the more popular browser extension wallets include:

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/)
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
- [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/download)


## Mobile-based Wallets

A mobile-based wallet is installed on you smart phone as a native application. Mobile wallets are popular due to their portability and because they can still be used with 
web-based dApps, typically by scanning a QR-code displayed on the desktop screen. Some of the most popular and trusted mobile wallets include:

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/articles/getting-started-mobile)
