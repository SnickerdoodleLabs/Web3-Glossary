# Common Terms

## Altcoin

Any cryptocurrency that isn’t Bitcoin or Ether, the two largest and most influential in the industry. Popular altcoins include Polygon, Solana, Ripple and our own forthcoming Doodle Tokens. 

## Cold Storage

The use of an offline piece of hardware to store passwords to online wallets. Written notes can also be considered a form of cold storage. 

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

A [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) is a smart contract program deployed to a blockchain. DAOs enable organization members
to propose and vote on the execution of rules built into the organization's on-chain protocol in a manner that is fully transparent, auditable, and tamper-resistant. 

## Hot Storage 

The use of software connected to the internet to store your passwords and wallet access information. 

## Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that exists on the blockchain. It can be owned and interacted with via the functionality provided by a crypto [wallet](#wallet). Simply put, an NFT consists of three parts: a contract address (the storage location on the blockchain), a token ID (a unique reference number within that storage location), and metadata (like a URL). Currently, the most common code standard for implementing NFTs is given by the [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard definition. Other consensus protocols that are not based on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) (EVM) have developed their own NFT standard definitions.

## Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

A decentralized exchange, commonly referred to as a DEX, is a smart contract program deployed to a blockchain that enables owners of fungible tokens to exchange them for other fungible tokens without the need for a third party to facilitate the trade. See our tutorial on [DEXs ](tutorials/how-do-i-use-a-dex.md)to learn how to use some of the most popular ones in Web3.

## Stablecoin 

Stablecoins are a type of digital currency that is backed by existing reserve assets to help them avoid drastic changes in valuation. There are four subcategories of stablecoin: (1) fiat-backed (tied to a government issued currency); (2) commodity-backed (tied to a physical commodity like oil or gold); (3) Crypto-backed (tied to other cryptocurrencies); and (4) algorithmic (tied to the number of tokens in circulation). 

## Subnet

A Subnet is **a sovereign network which defines its own rules regarding its membership and token economics**. It is composed of a dynamic subset of Avalanche validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains.

## Wallet

A crypto wallet (also commonly referred to as a digital wallet), is a piece of software that lets you interact with your digital assets on the blockchain. The wallet does this through the use of public-key cryptography technology to generate account addresses.

Nearly all consumer crypto wallets on the market today are Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets. This means that when you set up a new crypto wallet, it produces, in a mathematically secure fashion, a human-readable secret recovery phrase (also known as a mnemonic or seed phrase) that itself is then used to algorithmically generate a deterministic sequence of account addresses, each account having its own public-private key pair. It is these addresses themselves (along with signatures generated from their private keys) that are used to prove ownership of digital assets on the blockchain. Your secret recovery phrase can be used to regenerate your accounts and the accounts’ public-private key pairs by importing the seed into a new wallet software application.

**WARNING**: Store your seed phrase somewhere secure to recover your accounts in case of an emergency and keep the private keys it generates private; A legitimate application 
will never ask you for your private keys or seed phrase and you should never reveal them to any third party, ever.
