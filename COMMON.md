## Wallet

A crypto wallet (also commonly referred to as a digital wallet), is a piece of software that lets you interact with your digital assets on the blockchain. The wallet does this through the use of public-key cryptography technology to generate account addresses.

Nearly all consumer crypto wallets on the market today are Heirarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets. This means that when you set up a new crypto wallet, it produces, in a mathematically secure fashion, a human-readable secret recovery phrase (also known as a mnemonic or seed phrase) that itself is then used to algorithmically generate a deterministic sequence of account addresses, each account having its own public-private key pair. It is these addresses themselves (along with signatures generated from their private keys) that are used to prove ownership of digital assets on the blockchain. Your secret recovery phrase can be used to regenerate your accounts and the accountsâ€™ public-private key pairs by importing the seed into a new wallet software application.

WARNING: Store your seed phrase somewhere secure to recover your accounts in case of an emergency and keep the private keys it generates private; Hypernet.ID will never ask you for your private keys or seed phrase and you should never reveal them to any third party, ever.

Cypto wallets currently take two main form-factors: browser extensions and mobile apps.
