## Web3 Glossary

This is the Web3 Glossary maintained by [Snickerdoodle Labs](https://snickerdoodle.com) which aims to be a trusted source of information for beginners entering the wide world of Web3. The Web3 Glossary contains tutorials and definitions for the most common and uncommon situations and vocabulary you might encounter when navigating this new technology landscape.

We hope our community will help with this effort by proposing their own contributions. Check out the Web3 Glossary [Github repo](https://github.com/SnickerdoodleLabs/Web3-Glossary) and make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to suggest your own additions (don't forget to drop us a star :wink:). You can also open an 
[issue](https://github.com/SnickerdoodleLabs/Web3-Glossary/issues/new/choose) and describe a new word or tutorial you'd like to see added without going through the trouble 
of using git.
